-----Fixes-----
- I have made a few changes to the header.php to allow the search features to work
- I have also fixed the issue with the css styles not displaying correctly
	- All the links should now be blue
	- The top Nav bar is now visible and on the right side

-----Search-----
- There is a a new js file in the js folder called seach.js that handles the search as you type
- 2 new files search.php and search_db.php have been added
	- search_db.php handles the search as you type
	- search.php displays the table when you click search with a keyword
- The search implemented only searches words that start with what you are typing or start with the sequence entered
